    <h2>About</h2>My name is Spencer Novick and I am a 15 year old High School student. During the first lesson in my physics class regarding electronic circuits (which dealt with the first two things currently available on the calculator), I realized that I could make things "simpler" with a calculator for it. In some ways, it is simpler, but it did take a good 6-10 hours in total to code, set up, try to host and eventually give up and move to tumblr.
